# hello-world

My first repo on GitHub

## Purpose of this Repository

1. Learn GitHub
1. Understand what's involved in creating and managing a repo
1. Connect VSCode, GitKraken, and GitHub Desktop to GitHub
1. Practice with both **GitHub Flow** and **Fork-and-Branch** workflows:
    1. Create second GitHub account ([@jpriest-dev](https://github.com/jpriest-dev)) for testing purposes
    1. **GitHub Flow** on a shared repo

        Uses two repos:
        * _Repository on GitHub_ (remote)
        * _Cloned repository_ (local)
    1. **Fork-and-Branch Workflow** (also know as **Fork-and-Pull Request Workflow**)

        Uses three repos:
        * _Original repository_ (remote) - An open source repo on GitHub
        * _Forked repository_ (remote) - my copy of the open source repo on Github
        * _Cloned (local) repository_ (from Forked) - my local copy of my forked repo

1. Create a Gist to detail the steps for forking from an existing project and contributing to the codebase using **GitHub Fork & Pull Request Workflow**

    Link for my first Gist is here: [GitHub-Fork.md](https://gist.github.com/james-priest/74188772ef2a6f8d7132d0b9dc065f9c)

## Conclusion

*Finally*, I'm using git like a **PRO**!
